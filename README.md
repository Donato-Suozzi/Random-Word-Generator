# A Random Word Generator, that's it

Welcome human to this repository, how have you been?

Anyway welcome to my second doo doo project.

I don't know why are you here, but thanks for been here. :D

Reurning on the project, the code is simple and is created by a ooga booga cave man brain, so isn't the best, but do his work.

It will generate a **random** word, so if you are with your friends, you can use this project for a _simple_ game.

_There are 4 steps_:
+ you have to pronounce the generated word
+ spell it
+ tell the meaning of it.

I suggest to play this game when you're drunk (or with really easy-laught friends).

It is user-friendly and drunk-friendly. (There is only one button...)

The design is crap, because I'm lazy.

And remember: **"Stay in School, Smoke Crack, Drink Responsibly, Bye!"**
